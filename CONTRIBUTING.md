## Raising an issue

If you're looking to raise an issue, just head on over to the [issues log](https://github.com/JasonMillward/Autorippr/issues) and create a new issue.

Tag the issue as a [bug] or [feature request] to help keep things neat.

But before you go and press that submit button take a look at the information you're giving, is it enough?

Keys points to include are:

* General computer info
    * Operating system
        * Name and version
    * General hardware inside (If related to compression). eg; Dual core intel & 2 dvd drives

* Python
    * Version of python

* Autorippr
    * Version of Autorippr

* Detailed description of the issue and debug logs if possible.
    * If the issue is with Autorippr, add `--debug` to the command line options for more information.

Providing this information upfront can assist with diagnosing any issues.
